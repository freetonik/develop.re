A **hook** is a functionality of software that allows users to have their own [[code]] called under certain circumstances. It's a generic term without a formal definition.

## Examples
I. [[Git]] has a way to fire off custom scripts when certain important actions occur. Client-side hooks are triggered by operations such as committing and merging, while server-side hooks run on network operations such as receiving pushed commits.

II. Stripe payment system provides [[webhooks]] to notify about events happening in the user's account. This way the developer can, for example, trigger a new email when their customer's card is charged. [Read more about Stripe webooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks).
